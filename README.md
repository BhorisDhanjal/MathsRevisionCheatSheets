# Maths Revision Cheat Sheets

I've stored here a few math revision cheat sheets I made on Latex.

I don't claim any of these sheets are fully exhaustive of course. But they're a useful reference to have for quick look ups.

The topics I've included are:
1. [Group Theory](Group%20Theory%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf)
2. [Ring and Field Theory](Ring%20and%20Field%20Theory%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf)
3. [Complex Analysis](Complex%20Analysis%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf)
4. [Galois Theory](Galois%20Theory%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf)
5. [Measure Theory](Measure%20Theory%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf)

In progress
1. Commutative Algebra
2. Category Theory
3. Algebraic topology (I don't aim to fully complete this anytime soon only going through chp 1 and 4 of Hatcher)

You are free to use and share these sheets. If you notice a mistake or want to collaborate to add a new subject feel free to make a pull request here.

I've used various common books and online resources in making these sheets a non-exhaustive list is included here: [References](References.md).

Special thanks to the team at [quiver](https://github.com/varkor/quiver) for making my life so much easier with their commutative diagram editor.
